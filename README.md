CicadaOS
Hello there. I'm Wayqax, the Project Manager of CicadaOS. Project Cicada was a ongoing scratch project where a team of developers decided to take on the challenge of creating a fully functional OS on the platform. Sadly this fell apart due to inactivity. 

I plan to recreate this OS, as an actual OS or Browser with the original team members and new. The following information to contact me is below.

Discord Account: Wayqax#9007
(Account info may be added)

In order to join the Discord, I have to verify you fit for the team, as the server is for Developers only and not for the normal eye. Exposing any of this information on the server will result in a direct exile from the server and team.
Thank you for reading, 

Wayqax
Cicada OS Peoject Manager
